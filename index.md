# Digital Rain

## Introduction
This project is a C++ application designed to look like the "digital rain" effect that is associated with futuristic or hacker aesthetics. Inspired from the movie The Matrix, the goal of this project was to create such a thing by bringing in things during my C++ module such as file structure, proper coding practices and modern C++ as a whole.

In this project, the rain streams consists of multiple "raindrops" made of random characters, falling from the top of the terminal and being replaced by new ones that are positioned differently. By implementing this as a project, I gained good experience with managing memory, understanding C++ objects and optimising performance.

The goal of this blog is to walk through the process of creating this digital rain effect, detailing the steps to take it from project brief to built using the C++ programming language.

### Overall
I had fun and frustration with this, I got to make something that felt more like a personal project than a very strict brief that had to be followed. Even writing this blog, it was definitely my least favourite part but now I can potentially add GitHub pages to other projects which is better than just a sole ReadMe full of plaintext.
