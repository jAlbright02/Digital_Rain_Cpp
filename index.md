# Digital Rain

## Introduction
This project is a C++ application designed to look like the "digital rain" effect that is associated with futuristic or hacker aesthetics. Inspired from the movie The Matrix, the goal of this project was to create such a thing by bringing in things during my C++ module such as file structure, proper coding practices and modern C++ as a whole.

In this project, the rain streams consists of multiple "raindrops" made of random characters, falling from the top of the terminal and being replaced by new ones that are positioned differently. By implementing this as a project, I gained good experience with managing memory, understanding C++ objects and optimising performance.

The goal of this blog is to walk through the process of creating this digital rain effect, detailing the steps to take it from project brief to built using the C++ programming language.

## Project Insight & Reflection

### Did I enjoy doing this project?
#### Yes.
I got to developed an application that wasn't just another CRUD style piece, as many other modules may do so. It was allowed to be as difficult as I wanted it to be, provided the rubric was adhered to with essentials like code style, structure, this blog, etc.

I do wish this wasn't a 4<sup>th</sup> year module as I found myself taking away time I would have spent on this, to go work on my final year project. Other than that it was something different and I appreaciated that.

### What will I take from this?
#### Good practices and a good base to continue on with C++
This [website](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) was a big help while trying to keep my code clean and correct. As well, I referenced back to labs done within the class as it was often similar to what I needed to add into this project - I did this heavily at the start as the documentation was a lot (daunting even) to try and sift through. 

#### New language to develop in
Thanks to this project (and the C++ Programming module as a whole) I feel confident in beginning to develop personal projects in this that I may have felt avoidant of before. A lot of [game development uses C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages-for-game-development/) and one of the [most popular engines](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/programming-with-cplusplus-in-unreal-engine) for game dev heavily relies on it. Without the practical labs that explained the very basics, which gave me a good foundation, to work on this project I don't think I'd have been too pushed on learning this language. Parts of this project like how the class is structured, and used, was from how the Programmer/Matrix labs which we have done over the last 10 weeks. 

### Overall
I had fun and frustration with this, I got to make something that felt more like a personal project than a very strict brief that had to be followed. Even writing this blog, it was definitely my least favourite part but now I can potentially add GitHub pages to other projects which is better than just a sole ReadMe full of plaintext.
