# Problem Solving

## Old Iterations
First attempt consisted of getting single characters to ‘rain’ down. All done in a single main.cpp file. 
Hard to read, stuttered printing and overall just messy.

Second attempt included breaking this out into sections, the code remained mainly the same as the focus here was to break the project structure up into sections.

Third attempt resulted in using universally preferred methods of randomization, arrays of (random) characters being printed and the use of more windows functions such as changing color and hiding the cursor. File structure stayed the same and as a result a class has not yet been implemented, a struct and multiple files defining functions are what runs the project currently.
